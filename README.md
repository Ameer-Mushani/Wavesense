# Wavesense
Hardware project involving capactive touch sensors and Neopixel LEDs. 

The touchsensor project interfaces with external capactive touch sensors then using RS-232 Protocol transmits to the board controlling the LEDS. The wave project receives the data from the touchsensor in the form of an 8 bit number and displays the number using 8 LEDs.
